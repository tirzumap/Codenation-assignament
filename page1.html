    <h2>Myself</h2>
    <p class="aqua">Hi, my name is Petru, I’d describe myself as being very resourceful and ambitious at the same time. I find solutions, get creative and solve problems without needing the help . I know when to ask for help and I don’t stay quiet if I do need assistance. But when it is possible to handle something without occupying the time of others, I do it and I consider myself very good at it.I always had a passion for coding because it is usable art.</p>

    <h2>My family</h2>
    <p>A family is the most important place for any individual and it is considered as the root of people. Without a family, one cannot have a decent and happy life. I also live in a family consisting of several members.In my family, basically, we are five members altogether. They are – my 3 kids, my wife and me.My family is important to me for different reasons. First of all, it is the place where I belong to. Literally, at the end of the day, I return to my home where my family lives. I cannot think that I am living without my family.I am lucky to have such a family.   .....</p>
